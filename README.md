# BRFSS_Capstone2
Second capstone from Springboard data science bootcamp. 


## Problem statement formation:
### How can the NIMH decrease the median time delay for mental health treatment through the
development of an app that screens individuals for mental illnesses?
## Context: According to the NIMH, one in five Americans live with a mental illness. This can include both
mental, behavioral, or emotional disorders. In addition, according to the NIMH data from 2017, among
the 46.6 million adults with any mental illness, 19.8 million (42.6%) received mental health services in
the past year. Furthermore, in 2017, the NIMH identified that 4.5% of all U.S. adults experienced a
serious mental illness (SMI), meaning that the SMI substantially interfered with or limited one or more
major life activities (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2018). As the effects
of mental illness can be severe, it is prudent to diagnose and treat individuals with mental illness in a
timely manner. There are significant delays in diagnosing and treating a mental illness after initial onset
(McLaughline, 2004).
## Criteria for Success:
The creation of an app that will screen individuals for depressive disorders and refer
them to a psychiatrist immediately. Success will be measured by assessing the delay in treatment in
upcoming years. It is expected that the median delay time will decrease from 11 years until the first
contact with a psychiatrist, to less than one year.
